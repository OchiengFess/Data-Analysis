🚐 RV & Camper Van Analytics & Predictive Modeling
===================================================

📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW
--------------------
This end-to-end project simulates a data science solution for an RV and camper van rental business. It covers the full data pipeline—from data ingestion and EDA to machine learning, pricing optimization, and predictive maintenance.

I designed and analyzed a multi-table dataset to derive actionable insights and build models that can drive smarter decisions across operations, marketing, pricing, and vehicle health monitoring.

🧠 KEY OBJECTIVES
-------------------
- Understand camper usage, demand, and booking behavior
- Predict breakdown risk using sensor logs
- Forecast demand and optimize dynamic pricing
- Evaluate marketing performance using MMM (Marketing Mix Modeling)

📂 MODULES & DELIVERABLES
---------------------------
1. **EDA & Insights**: Deep exploratory analysis of bookings, fleet, customers, and revenue
2. **Demand Forecasting**: Time-series forecasting for bookings and revenue
3. **Pricing Optimization**: ML-based pricing models based on demand drivers
4. **Marketing Mix Modeling**: Attribution of channel ROI and optimization budget allocation
5. **Predictive Maintenance**: ML classification of at-risk vehicles and SARIMAX sensor forecasting
6. **Streamlit App** (optional): Soon

🔧 TECH STACK
--------------
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, statsmodels)
- Plotly / Seaborn / Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Streamlit (for optional deployment)
- GitHub (for version control & documentation)

🎯 OUTCOME
-----------
The project demonstrates how data science can optimize core areas of an RV rental business: reducing downtime, maximizing revenue, and improving service delivery.
